     <a href = "StudyingReact-part2.html">go to part2</a></p>
     <p> GEtting start - please read that for remeber how to work with react from the start</p>
     <h1>Start with react - 3 ways </h1>

     <ul>
        <li>1- The simple way with manually adding tags, and start compilers when you need.
        <br/>This is how this project is built. But for example u encounter problems when
      U are need server, some syntax not work on local machine. It's recommended by them to existing websites, apparently because
    they have already running enviroment.</li>
        <li>2- With create react app command - this is the primary and recommended way.
        see <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">here</a> about that
      this is very simple , just 3 commands :
          <pre>
            npx create-react-app my-app
            cd my-app
            npm start
          </pre>
         </li>
         <li>with manually install packages like explained <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/reactjs/reactjs_environment_setup.htm">here</a>
          </li>

     </ul>
     <h2>Anyway - u should create basic projects for convient of the work</h2>
     <p>Sometimes there is problems to copy projects from the windows, so u can do it from the CMD<br/>
    <pre>***xcopy /S sourceFolder destinationfolder</pre>   <br/>
https://ss64.com/nt/xcopy.html
</p>
      <h2>Don't forget that there is changes that need to be done, when u moving to producton area. Don't
      remeber when but it's reminded in all through the guides </h2>
     <h1>Add react : <br> This is component from the doc </h1>
     <h2>1- create dom element - it's mean simple div element </h2>
      <div id = "reactApp1"></div>

      <h2>2- load react - Here below we load react and my component</h2>
      <!-- ... other HTML ... -->
      <p>Here is my component</p>
      <div id ="component2"></div>

      <p>Here is my component with JSX from inside </p>
      <div id ="jsxComponent"></div>

      <p>Here is my component with JSX from outside </p>
      <div id ="jsxComponent2"></div>
      <div id ="aaa"></div>

      <p>Here is my component react from inside. is work ? YEAH!!! </p>
      <div id ="component22"></div>

      <h1>That's was guideness for beginnin - if you don't remember how
        to start please see   <a href = 'https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html'>that</a>
      </h1>

      <p><a href = 'https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html'>Here</a> is documentation
        for creating app project with their recommendation. U can consider it in future,
        believe there are a lot of methods.
