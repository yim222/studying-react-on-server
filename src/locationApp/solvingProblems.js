      <h1>Objects in states problem</h1>

      <p>This solution discuss in the problem of data note merging when updating states.<br/>
        In regular state with a, b, c ... properties, when I update one property with set state,
        the other values stay as it is, and the changed value merged into the state.<br/>
        Unlike that when it's object. When I change the object value it's override all the value.<br/>
        What I have understand is that the state is just work like that, maybe it's because the idea of then
        state method, that I am missing. Anyeway...
        Let do example : I have
        two components representation to shapes array.
        in one is all as vars, and in one every one is obejcts.

        lets say there is rectangleA, rectangleB, triangleA, triangleB, triangleC. The Sides of two shapes- Square and Triangle.
        <br/>
        SO the SMART way should be to define differents object to each shape.
        The less smart and less organize way is to define all together.

        That's the problem, in the smart way problems happenings.

       <p>First lets see the "all together" way </p>

         <h1>But -  The Best solution is the simplest - Just Don't do it</h1>


         <p style= {{color:'black'}}>After checking more info about this. I saw that it's consider to not good practice,
         and it could cause problem with the asynchronous states and all that.
         so it's better to define subProperty in the name ,
         and apparently each component should be by itself not containing a a lot of sub-Objects
          see here - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43040721/how-to-update-nested-state-properties-in-react/51136076#51136076 <br/>

        <h2>It's important insight on react, it use shallow - chaeck only the 1st level, and then rendered. ,
